                <h3>6. Subscriptions</h3>
                <p>Some parts of the Service, including, but not limited to, the Pro Plan, Design Plan, and the Display Plan, plus added Locations, are made available on a paid subscription basis ("Subscription(s)"). Pricing and included features for the Subscriptions (“Subscription Plan(s)”) are set forth here: <a href="https://www.myrestaurantmenu.com/menu/pricing.do" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Our Pricing</a>. “<strong>Subscription Fees</strong>” means all fees associated with your Subscription.
                </p><p>You will be billed in advance on a recurring and periodic basis ("Billing Cycle"). Billing Cycles are set on a monthly or yearly basis. </p>
                <p><strong>Auto-Renewal: You agree that at the end of each Billing Cycle, your Subscription will automatically renew and your payment method for such Subscription will automatically be charged at the start of each new Subscription period for the fees and taxes applicable to that Billing Cycle, under the same conditions as the prior Billing Cycle unless you cancel your Subscription prior to your renewal date.</strong></p>
                <p>A valid payment method, including credit card, is required to process the payment for your Subscription. You must provide MyRestaurantMenu with accurate and complete billing information including full name, address, state, zip code, and valid payment method information. By submitting such payment information, you automatically authorize MyRestaurantMenu to charge all Subscription Fees incurred through your account to any such payment instruments.</p>
                <p>Should automatic billing fail to occur for any reason, MyRestaurantMenu may attempt to charge the credit card on file one or more times. If your form of payment fails after several attempts, your account will move to canceled status. Reactivating a canceled account requires payment at the most current rates.</p>
                <p>You may cancel your Subscription either through your <a href="/account/locations">Account Settings</a> page or by contacting MyRestaurantMenu’ customer support team at service@MyRestaurantMenu.com and indicating your intention to cancel your Subscription.</p>
                <h3>7. Effect of Cancellation</h3>
                <p>The features and privileges of MyRestaurantMenu are no longer available through a canceled account. Any web links you have established for QR codes, Online Menus and Link Pages will be deactivated. Digital display screens will also be deactivated. File storage is not guaranteed for canceled accounts. Designs may be subject to removal and deletion. Reactivating a canceled account requires payment at the most current rates.
                </p><h3>8. Fees and Fee Changes</h3>
                <p>MyRestaurantMenu, in its sole discretion and at any time, may modify the Subscription Fees for the Subscriptions, including Add-Ons. Any Subscription Fee change will become effective at the end of the then-current Billing Cycle.
                </p><p>MyRestaurantMenu will provide you with reasonable prior notice of any change in Subscription Fees. Your continued use of the Service constitutes your agreement to pay the modified Subscription Fees.</p>
                <p>Subscription Fees are stated exclusive of any taxes or similar governmental assessments of any nature, including, for example, value-added, sales, use or withholding taxes, assessable by any jurisdiction (collectively, “Taxes”). You will be responsible for paying all Taxes associated with your Subscription, except for those taxes based on our net income. Should any payment for the Service be subject to withholding tax by any government, you will reimburse us for such withholding tax.</p>
                <h3>9. Refunds</h3>
                <p>Payment obligations are non-cancelable, and fees paid are non-refundable and there are no credits for partially used Subscription periods.
                </p><h3>10. No Free Accounts</h3>
                <p>As of September, 2025, MyRestaurantMenu no longer offers free subscription plans.
                </p><h3>11. Software and File Compatibility</h3>
                <p>We are constantly updating our software platform. Our software versions and file formats become obsolete and unusable over time as we strive to keep up with advances in hosting services, operating systems and browsers. We strive to minimize adverse effects on customers, offering extended periods of notifications, support, instructions, and pathways for updating. Our customer success agents are trained to help you. Obsolete or unusable files may be archived, removed and/or permanently deleted from your Account at any time.
